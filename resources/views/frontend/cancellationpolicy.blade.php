   If you need to cancel or reschedule your tour due to unavoidable circumstances, please notify us in writing. Cancellation charges will apply based on when we receive your written request. Kindly review the cancellation policy outlined below:
</p>

<ol>
   <li>
      Any changes to government taxes, safari fees, or related charges will be communicated to you in advance via email or phone before your scheduled travel date.
   </li>
   <blockquote>
      <strong>Note:</strong> In case your safari booking is unsuccessful due to technical issues or unavailability of seats, a full refund will be issued directly to your bank account.
   </blockquote>
   <li>
      Cancellations during peak seasons (Holi, Diwali, Christmas, and New Year) are subject to a separate cancellation policy, which will be shared with you accordingly.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Liabilities & Limitations:</strong> Any additional charges incurred due to increased permit fees, fuel prices, taxes, museum entries, or guide fees as revised by the Government of India will be charged separately.
   </li>
   <li>
      In situations beyond our control—such as natural calamities, strikes, festivals, overbooked accommodations, or access restrictions at destinations—we will make every effort to provide suitable alternatives. However, refunds or compensation for such events are not guaranteed.
   </li>
   <li>
      Any legal disputes will fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in New Delhi.
   </li>
   <li>
      Please note: The day of the scheduled tour is not counted while calculating cancellation timelines.
   </li>
</ol>
